# Fault Detection and Prevention using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting irregularities in energy consumption patterns using deep learning techniques for fault detection and prevention. The system leverages an autoencoder model to identify anomalies based on temperature data.

## Repository
GitHub: [Fault Detection and Prevention using Machine Learning](https://github.com/its-anuskapalit/Fault-Detection-and-Prevention-using-Machine-Learning)

## Dataset
We use a thermal imaging dataset for fault detection and classification:

## Features
- Deep learning-based anomaly detection using autoencoders.
- Visualization of detected anomalies and reconstruction errors.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed along with the necessary dependencies.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/its-anuskapalit/Fault-Detection-and-Prevention-using-Machine-Learning.git
   cd Fault-Detection-and-Prevention-using-Machine-Learning
   ```

## Usage
- Upload temperature readings to detect anomalies.
- View predictions in real-time with visualized results.
- Use the model for preventive maintenance by identifying irregular energy consumption patterns.

## Model
The deep learning model is built using an autoencoder architecture that reconstructs input features and identifies anomalies based on reconstruction error.
